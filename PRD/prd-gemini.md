### **3. Core Features & Requirements**

#### **3.1. FR-001: Sudoku Grid**
* **Description:** The main game interface shall feature a standard 9x9 Sudoku grid, subdivided into nine 3x3 subgrids (or "boxes").
* **Functionality:**
    * The grid must clearly display the initial, unchangeable numbers of the puzzle (often called "givens").
    * Empty cells must be selectable by the user.
    * When a user selects an empty cell and inputs a number, that number should appear in the cell. User-entered numbers should be visually distinct from the initial "given" numbers (e.g., different color or font weight).
    

#### **3.2. FR-002: Number Input Panel**
* **Description:** A panel, typically located below or to the side of the grid, shall display the numbers 1 through 9 for user input.
* **Functionality:**
    * Clicking/tapping a number on the panel and then an empty cell on the grid places that number in the cell.
    * When all nine instances of a specific number (e.g., all nine '7's) have been correctly placed on the grid, the corresponding number on the input panel shall be **grayed out** or visually disabled to indicate its completion.

#### **3.3. FR-003: Puzzle Generator**
* **Description:** The game must include a backend engine capable of generating valid Sudoku puzzles.
* **Functionality:**
    * Every puzzle generated must have a **single, unique solution**.
    * The generator must ensure that the puzzle is solvable through logical deduction alone, without requiring guessing.

#### **3.4. FR-004: Difficulty Classification**
* **Description:** The puzzle generator must be able to classify the difficulty of each puzzle it creates.
* **Functionality:**
    * Puzzles will be categorized into three levels: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**.
    * The user must be able to select their desired difficulty level before starting a new game.
    * The difficulty rating should be displayed on the game screen.

#### **3.5. FR-005: Gameplay Timer**
* **Description:** A timer will track the user's session duration.
* **Functionality:**
    * The timer shall be prominently displayed at the top of the game screen.
    * It should start counting up from 00:00 as soon as the puzzle is loaded and displayed to the user.
    * The format should be MM:SS or HH:MM:SS, depending on expected play times.

#### **3.6. FR-006: Pause Functionality**
* **Description:** A pause button will allow the user to suspend the game.
* **Functionality:**
    * A 'Pause' button will be visible on the game screen.
    * When pressed, the **timer must stop** immediately.
    * To prevent cheating (e.g., solving the puzzle outside the game and returning), the game grid must be **completely hidden or obfuscated** by an overlay (e.g., a solid color screen with a "Paused" message).
    * A 'Resume' button on the overlay will allow the user to continue the game, at which point the grid becomes visible again and the timer resumes counting from where it left off.

#### **3.7. FR-007: UI/UX Design**
* **Description:** The overall visual aesthetic of the game must be simple and minimalist.
* **Functionality:**
    * **Color Palette:** Use a limited, clean color palette (e.g., shades of gray, white, black, with a single accent color for highlighting selected cells or buttons).
    * **Typography:** Employ a clear, legible font.
    * **Layout:** The interface should be uncluttered, with the grid as the central focus. Buttons and other UI elements should be intuitive and unobtrusive. The design should prioritize function over ornamentation.
