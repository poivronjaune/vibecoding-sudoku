Help me design a game to practice SUDOKU techniques.

I want a product requirements document (PRD) that will serve as the basis for the game we will generate using a good LLM.

Here are the first requirements we will start with (we add more requirements as the document evoves):
1-A grid to place numbers in and display the initial numbers of the puzzle
2-A panel with the available numbers to place (the panel numbers will become grayed out when all numbers are of that kind are placed on the puzzle)
3-A generator of sudoku that will produce a puzzle that can be resolved
4-The generator must classify the generated puzzle as easy, meduim or hard
5-A timer at the top of the game screen to display the time the puzzle is being played
6-A pause button to suspend the game (the time must stop and the grid must be covered to hide the numbers) cheating prevention :)
7-Graphics must be simple and minimalist

Please generate a PRD with these initial requirements.


PROMPT for code generation
I have created 3 PRD documents to descripbe the application I want. Please use these documents to create a fully functional python game using pygame. I wish to have a package called sudoku in which you will put all the code.
In the root folder, create a TOML file with poetry syntax for dependency. In the required python languag use a minimum of python 3.10 and maximum of less than pythn 3.13.

Generate the files with code and add these to my root folder. Create any subfolder that are required and any files that are not already created.
Add a .gitignore file for github
Add a readme file to explain hoe to install/check dependencies, poetry and python.

GO DO IT
